You can use this code and modify it. To use this bot, you need to replace TOKEN with your own bot token. 
You can obtain a bot token by creating a new bot with the BotFather on Telegram. 
You also need to install the telebot library by running pip install pyTelegramBotAPI. 
Once you have done that, you can run the bot and interact with it on Telegram. 
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
